For this project I created a password generator. This password generator could be used for making different passwords that aren't easibly hackable. 

I initially started with writing my html code and then my style.css code. Once I got my password generator to look how I wanted it to look, I began the process of writing my java code. 

Javascript had been a difficult process for me to learn and understand but I believe creating this helped me understand javascript more. I was able to create the different aspects of java script, but I struggled with having my password generator actually create passwords. By proofreading through it and having a second set of eyes look through it, I was able to get the password generator to work.
